            My name is Eshani. For me finding the right balance in life is an edventure - education and adventure. Learning from your experiences, learning new things, traveling and experiencing different cultures, food. Throw in some Hi tech in there and it's a perfect blend. I am a preschool / kindergarten teacher, architect, mother, wife, daughter and more. I love to paint, cook and bake with my children. I also love to experiment with food and obsess over making it nutritious, healthy and yet delicious. Yoga, dance, and fitness is another passion of mine. As a family, we love to travel and experience different cultures.

            I started out with a degree in <b style="color: darkblue; font-style: italic;">architecture</b> and worked for many years as an architect and interior designer. When I volunteered at my daughter's school, I realized I love being around little children so I went back to school and got my <b style="color: darkblue; font-style: italic;">Master Teacher certificate</b>. I have been teaching for the past 10 years. I am now, back in school learning some coding and web designing. My goal is to earn a <b style="color: darkblue; font-style: italic;">Web Programming degree </b> and get a job that allows me to use my design skills and spend time with my family.
