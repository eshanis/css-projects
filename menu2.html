                <p>Broccolini is a hybrid of broccoli and kale with a slightly nutty flavor. At its best, it’s cooked until the stalks are just crisp-tender and the small florets turn bright green. Here, a rich, creamy blue cheese dressing tops off the roasted broccolini with that wonderful salty, tangy, blue cheesy bite.</p>
